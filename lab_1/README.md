RGB (Red, Green, Blue): This is the most common color model in which colors are represented as combinations of red, green, and blue components.

CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black): CMYK is a color model used in printing, where colors are represented using percentages of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness): HSL is a color model that represents colors based on their hue (color), saturation (intensity), and lightness (brightness).
