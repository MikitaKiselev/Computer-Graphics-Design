# Table of Contents
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

# Usage
## Upon running the application, a Tkinter window will appear with input fields for coordinates and buttons for each algorithm. Follow these steps:
1. Enter the starting and ending coordinates for the desired shape or line.
2. Click on the corresponding algorithm button to visualize the line clipping process.

# Implemented Algorithms
- **Liang-Barsky Algorithm:**
  Provides a step-by-step visualization of the line clipping process.
  
- **Cyrus-Beck Algorithm:**
  Clips a line using the Cyrus-Beck algorithm.

# GUI Layout
## The GUI is divided into two sections: an input menu and a canvas display.

## Input Menu
- **Browse Button:** Select a text file with coordinates.
- **Scale Entry:** Adjust the scale parameter to control the granularity of the grid.
- **Algorithm Buttons:** Choose between Liang-Barsky and Cyrus-Beck algorithms.

## Canvas Display
- The canvas shows the drawn shapes with grid lines.

# Notes
- The application supports visualization of line clipping algorithms in a 2D space.
- Adjust the scale parameter to control the granularity of the grid.
- The time window displays the execution time of the chosen algorithm.
